First and foremost is my love for\n                baseballâ€”a sport that has been a part of my identity since I was\n                young. I find immense joy and camaraderie in the game, both as a\n                player and a devoted fan. Additionally, my fascination with\n                technology has been a driving force in my personal growth.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                From an early age, I immersed myself in the world of computers\n                and programming. This interest led me to pursue a career in\n                Software Engineering, where I blend my passion for technology\n                with the excitement of creating innovative solutions. Born in\n                the Dominican Republic, I brought the rich tapestry of my\n                culture to New York at a young age. This unique blend of\n                experiences has shaped my perspective and instilled in me a\n                strong work ethic and resilience.\n              </p>\n\n              <h2>Goals</h2>\n              <p>\n                One of my primary goals is to contribute meaningfully to the\n                field of software engineering by developing innovative solutions\n                that address real-world challenges. I aim to continuously\n                enhance my skills and stay abreast of emerging technologies to\n                deliver high-quality and efficient software.\n              </p>\n\n              <button onClick={openResume} className=\"resume-button\">\n                Resume\n              </button>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default About;\n"],"names":["_jsx","id","children","_jsxs","className","src","aboutImage","alt","onClick","openResume","window","open","resume"],"sourceRoot":""}
